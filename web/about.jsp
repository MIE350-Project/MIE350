<h1>About us</h1>
<h2>Who we are?</h2>
<p>We're RoomSense, a team of third-year Industrial Engineering students in the course, MIE350: Design & Analysis of Information Systems! 
   For our undergrad term project, we were tasked to build a web app project that addresses a certain demand that we notice around us. 
   Through researching currently-existing systems, we found that relevant sites served only to provide results for room listings or 
   match potential roommates, but never both, which we felt would be a logical pairing. And so, the miRoommate Finder was born.
   <br>
   <br>
   The miRoommate Finder is essentially a tool that functions as both a room AND roommate finder, which means you can find 
   that <b>perfect rental</b> all in one place! Currently, our listings are catered towards students from the University of Toronto, notably international
and exchange students. However, there's room for potential expansion for the scope of our web app in the future.</p>
